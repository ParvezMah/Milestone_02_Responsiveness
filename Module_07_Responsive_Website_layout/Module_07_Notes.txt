Question 1: What is the difference between Grid and Flexbox?

Answer: Grid and Flexbox are both CSS layout systems used to arrange elements on a web page, but they have different purposes:

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout): Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system designed to handle alignment and distribution of elements within a container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It is ideal for creating flexible and dynamic layouts for items within a container.

Grid (CSS Grid Layout): Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to define rows and columns to create a grid-like structure. It provides more control over the placement and sizing of elements within a container and is suitable for complex, grid-based layouts.
